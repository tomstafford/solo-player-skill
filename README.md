# Skill acquisition of solo players: a case study 

## `Coursework for PSY6422`


In this project, I leverage the research data of [Landfried et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211014), which is collected from the game *Conquer Club*.
While they mainly focus on **teamwork**'s effect on skill acquisition, I think a baseline which only consists of solo player's performance should be considered.
To justify the (early) learning pattern of solo players, in [the first notebook](/filter.ipynb) I filter the data of the palyers who **have never palyed with a teammate**.
Next, in [the second notebook](./visualisation.ipynb) I visualise and analyse the filtered data.
